KEY GENOMIC FINDINGS
================================================================================

REPORTABLE ALTERATIONS:

1. ARID1A - Y1281*
   - Transcript: NM_006015
   - Coding Effect: 3843_3845TGG>ATT
   - VAF: 14.5%

================================================================================
BIOMARKER FINDINGS
================================================================================

MICROSATELLITE STATUS: MS-Stable
- Clinical Significance: MSS tumors significantly LESS likely to respond to 
                         anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab)
- Frequency: MSI detected in 26-49% of urothelial carcinomas
- Note: Patient is MSS (microsatellite-stable), indicating MMR proficiency

TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN (TMB): 4 Muts/Mb
- Clinical Significance: LOW TMB - associated with LOWER rates of clinical benefit 
                         from PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors
- Context: Median TMB in bladder cancer (TCGA): 5.5 Muts/Mb
- Response Predictors:
  * Atezolizumab responders: ≥9.7 Muts/Mb
  * Pembrolizumab responders: median 12.3 Muts/Mb (vs 7.0 in non-responders)
  * Nivolumab responders: ≥9 Muts/Mb
- Patient TMB (4 Muts/Mb) is BELOW typical response thresholds

================================================================================
THERAPY IMPLICATIONS SUMMARY
================================================================================

NO COMPANION DIAGNOSTIC MATCHES:
- No FDA-approved therapies with companion diagnostic claims for detected alterations

POTENTIAL SENSITIVITIES (based on ARID1A):
✓ ATR inhibitors (M6620, ceralasertib, BAY 1895344, VX-970, berzosertib)
✓ EZH2 inhibitors (preclinical evidence in ovarian cancer)
✓ PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors
✓ Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy (ARID1A alterations may predict benefit)
✓ Pan-HDAC inhibitors (belinostat, panobinostat)

POTENTIAL RESISTANCE:
✗ Platinum-based chemotherapy (ARID1A loss associated with resistance)
✗ PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors (LOW TMB + MSS status = lower response likelihood)

================================================================================
IMMUNOTHERAPY CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

UNFAVORABLE BIOMARKERS FOR CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS:
1. TMB: 4 Muts/Mb (LOW - typical responders ≥9-12 Muts/Mb)
2. Microsatellite Status: MS-Stable (MSI-H more responsive)
3. Combined Profile: Suggests LOWER likelihood of benefit from single-agent 
                     pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or other checkpoint inhibitors

FAVORABLE FACTOR:
- ARID1A mutation: Some evidence suggests ARID1A alterations may predict 
                   sensitivity to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy despite low TMB

CLINICAL CONTEXT:
Patient achieved stable disease (6/20/2025 → 12/10/2025) on Keytruda + Padcev 
combination despite LOW TMB. This suggests:
1. Combination therapy (checkpoint inhibitor + ADC) overcame low TMB limitation
2. ARID1A mutation may have contributed to response
3. Padcev (nectin-4 ADC) provided complementary mechanism

NOTES & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. ARID1A Y1281* is the KEY ACTIONABLE MUTATION
   - Suggests sensitivity to ATR inhibitors (clinical trials available)
   - May explain partial response to checkpoint inhibitors despite low TMB

2. LOW TMB (4 Muts/Mb) typically predicts LOWER immunotherapy response
   - However, patient achieved stable disease on Keytruda + Padcev
   - Combination approach may have overcome low TMB limitation

3. MSS (Microsatellite Stable) status also suggests lower immunotherapy response
   - Reinforces need for combination strategies

4. TERT promoter mutation (67% of high-grade bladder cancers)
   - Associated with poor prognosis
   - Limited therapeutic options currently

5. MLL2 mutation may represent CLONAL HEMATOPOIESIS
   - May originate from blood cells, not tumor
   - Would require peripheral blood sequencing to confirm

6. Consider ATR inhibitor clinical trials
   - Multiple Phase 1/2 trials available
   - ARID1A mutation predicts potential sensitivity
   - Could be next-line therapy option

7. Continue combination approaches
   - Low TMB suggests single-agent checkpoint inhibitors less effective
   - Current Keytruda + Padcev combination working (stable disease)
   - Integrative protocol supporting conventional treatment
