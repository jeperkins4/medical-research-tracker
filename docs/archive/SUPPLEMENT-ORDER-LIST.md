- The K2 products recommended are K2-MK7 only (safe)

⚠️ **Magnesium:**
- Start with lower dose if stomach-sensitive
- Glycinate form is gentle (avoid oxide/citrate forms if sensitive)
- Take with food

⚠️ **Calcium:**
- Do NOT exceed 1200-1500mg/day from supplements
- Citrate form = better absorption than carbonate
- MUST take with K2 to prevent arterial calcification
