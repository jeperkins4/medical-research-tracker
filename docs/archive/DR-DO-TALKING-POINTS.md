# Dr. Do Appointment - Talking Points
## Rising Alkaline Phosphatase & Bone Metastases Risk

**Date:** _____________ (Schedule ASAP)  
**Prepared by:** John Perkins  
**Purpose:** Discuss rising Alk Phos trend and bone metastases prevention

---

## Opening Statement (30 seconds)

> "Dr. Do, I've been tracking my labs closely and noticed my Alkaline Phosphatase has risen significantly over the past 8 weeks - from 126 in early January to 165 on January 30th, which is above the normal range. I'm concerned this could indicate early bone metastases, and I'd like to discuss prevention strategies, specifically a bone scan and bisphosphonates."

---

## Key Data Points to Present

### 1. Alkaline Phosphatase Trend
- **Dec 5, 2025:** 137 U/L (normal)
- **Jan 9, 2026:** 126 U/L
- **Jan 16, 2026:** 140 U/L
- **Jan 30, 2026:** 165 U/L **HIGH** (above 147)

**Analysis:**
- 31% increase in 8 weeks
- Now above normal range (39-147 U/L)
- Steady upward trend since early January

### 2. Supporting Evidence
**PLOS One Study (2017):** "Serum calcium, alkaline phosphotase and hemoglobin as risk factors for bone metastases in bladder cancer"
- Elevated ALP significantly associated with bone mets in bladder cancer (P = 0.015)
- Early detection is critical for successful intervention
- 5.5% of bladder cancer patients develop bone metastases

**TUGAMO Study (British Journal of Cancer, 2013):**
- Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid) effective for bladder cancer/RCC bone metastases
- Reduces skeletal-related events (SRE)
- Lowers bone turnover markers including ALP

## Requested Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. 🚨 URGENT: Bone Scan
**Request:** Order full bone scan (technetium-99m or PET/CT)
**Reason:** Rule out current bone metastases, establish baseline
**Timeline:** ASAP (within 1-2 weeks)

### 2. 🚨 URGENT: Comprehensive Lab Panel
**Request:** Order the following labs:
- Alkaline Phosphatase (total) - recheck
- **Bone-specific ALP (BALP)** - more specific than total ALP
- Serum Calcium
- 25-OH Vitamin D
- Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
- **CTX (C-telopeptide)** - bone resorption marker
- **PINP (Procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide)** - bone formation marker (optional)

**Reason:** Comprehensive bone health assessment, differentiate bone vs. liver ALP
**Timeline:** This week

### 3. 🚨 URGENT: Bisphosphonates or Denosumab
**Request:** Discuss starting monthly bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy

**Options:**
- **Zoledronic acid (Zometa)** - IV infusion, monthly
  - 4mg IV over 15 minutes
  - Standard for bone metastases prevention/treatment
  - Evidence-based for bladder cancer (TUGAMO study)
  
- **Denosumab (Xgeva)** - SubQ injection, monthly
  - 120mg subcutaneous
  - Alternative if bisphosphonates contraindicated
  - Convenient (self-injectable)

**Reason:**
- Proven efficacy in bladder cancer bone metastases
- Inhibits osteoclast activity (reduces bone breakdown)
- Reduces skeletal-related events
- May lower ALP back to normal range

**Question for Dr. Do:**
- "Given my rising ALP and bladder cancer diagnosis, do you recommend starting prophylactic bisphosphonates now, or should we wait for bone scan results?"

---

## Current Supplement Protocol (For Discussion)

### Already Taking (Relevant to Bone Health):
- Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG) 1000mg - collagen synthesis (bone matrix support)
- Vitamin D3 1,000 IU daily **(planning to increase to 5,000 IU)**
- Low-sugar, anti-inflammatory diet

### Planning to Add This Week:
- **Vitamin K2-MK7 200mcg daily** - directs calcium to bones (critical with Eliquis)
- **Calcium Citrate 1200mg daily** - bone density support
- **Magnesium Glycinate 400mg daily** - required for Vitamin D activation
- **Boron 3mg daily** - improves calcium/magnesium metabolism

**Question for Dr. Do:**
- "Are there any interactions between these bone-supportive supplements and my current medications (Keytruda, Padcev, Eliquis, Synthroid)?"
- "Do you recommend any dosage adjustments?"

---

## Questions to Ask

### Diagnostic Questions:
1. "Could this ALP rise be from liver rather than bone? Should we check liver function tests?"
2. "Would bone-specific ALP be more informative than total ALP?"
3. "Should we also check for other bone mets markers like CTX or PINP?"
4. "What ALP level would trigger immediate intervention in your protocol?"

### Treatment Questions:
5. "If the bone scan is negative, do you still recommend prophylactic bisphosphonates given the rising ALP?"
6. "What's your experience with Zometa vs. Xgeva for bladder cancer patients?"
7. "How often would we recheck ALP after starting bisphosphonates?"
8. "What side effects should I watch for with bisphosphonates?"
9. "Do I need a dental exam before starting bisphosphonates?" (ONJ risk)
10. "Should I take calcium/vitamin D supplements while on bisphosphonates?" (usually recommended)

### Monitoring Questions:
11. "How often should we recheck ALP going forward?"
12. "What's our target ALP level?"
13. "If ALP continues rising despite bisphosphonates, what's the next step?"

## Potential Concerns Dr. Do May Raise

### "Let's wait and see if it continues rising"
**Response:** "I understand caution, but the PLOS One study shows ALP is a significant risk factor (P=0.015), and early intervention is critical. Given the 31% increase in just 8 weeks and that I'm now above normal range, I'd feel more comfortable being proactive. Could we at least get a bone scan and bone-specific ALP to assess the situation?"

### "Bisphosphonates have side effects"
**Response:** "I understand there are risks like ONJ and renal issues. My kidney function has been good (I can confirm latest creatinine if needed), and I'm willing to get a dental clearance. The TUGAMO study showed good efficacy in bladder cancer specifically. What do you think the risk/benefit looks like in my case?"

### "Your other supplements might interfere"
**Response:** "I've researched interactions and the supplements I'm adding (K2, calcium, magnesium, boron) are standard bone-health nutrients often recommended WITH bisphosphonates. I'm happy to adjust timing or dosages based on your recommendations. The Vitamin K2 is the MK-7 form, which is safe with Eliquis."
