## 9. Data Analytics and Research Use

### 9.1 Consent to De-Identified Analytics

By creating an account and using MyTreatmentPath, you consent to:

1. **De-identification of your data** using HIPAA Safe Harbor standards (45 CFR §164.514(b)(2))
2. **Aggregation** of your de-identified data with other users' data
3. **Use of de-identified analytics** to improve our services and contribute to cancer research
4. **External sharing** of de-identified, aggregated analytics with research partners and the public

### 9.2 What "De-Identified" Means

De-identified data means:
- ✅ All 18 HIPAA identifiers have been removed (name, email, exact age, city/ZIP, etc.)
- ✅ Data is aggregated with at least 10 other users (minimum group size: 11)
- ✅ You cannot be reasonably identified from the aggregated data
- ✅ Data is no longer considered Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA

### 9.3 Your Ownership of Personal Data

**You retain ownership** of your personal health information (PHI). We are merely the custodian.

**We own** the de-identified, aggregated analytics derived from multiple users' data.

**Example:**
- ❌ We do NOT own "John Perkins has bladder cancer" (your PHI)
- ✅ We DO own "15 users have bladder cancer Stage 4" (de-identified aggregate)

### 9.4 How Analytics Are Used

**We use de-identified analytics for:**
- Platform improvement and feature development
- Understanding common cancer treatment patterns
- Research publications and academic collaborations
- Public health reporting
- Demonstrating platform impact to investors and partners

**We DO NOT:**
- Sell de-identified analytics to advertisers
- Use analytics to discriminate against you
- Share data that could identify you personally
- Use your data for any purpose other than those disclosed

### 9.5 External Sharing

We may share de-identified, aggregated analytics with:
- **Academic researchers** studying cancer treatment outcomes
- **Public health organizations** (CDC, cancer registries)
- **Research institutions** conducting IRB-approved studies
- **The public** via research papers, blog posts, or reports

**Important:** Once data is de-identified, it is no longer subject to HIPAA restrictions. However, we maintain ethical standards and only share analytics for legitimate research and public health purposes.

### 9.6 Opt-Out Right

**You may opt out** of having your data included in future analytics aggregation:
- Email: privacy@mytreatmentpath.com
- Subject: "Analytics Opt-Out"
- Include your account email address

**Effect of opt-out:**
- ✅ Your data will be excluded from future analytics generation
- ✅ Your personal health records remain accessible to you
- ❌ Analytics already generated before opt-out will remain (but cannot identify you)
- ❌ Opt-out does not delete your personal data (use account deletion for that)

### 9.7 Account Deletion

If you delete your account:
- ✅ Your personal health information (PHI) is permanently deleted
- ✅ Your identifiable data is removed from our systems
- ❌ De-identified analytics generated before deletion will remain in aggregate form
- ❌ We cannot "un-aggregate" data to remove your historical contribution

**Why?** De-identified data cannot be linked back to you, so it's impossible to identify and remove your specific contribution from aggregated counts.

**Example:**
- Before deletion: "15 users have PIK3CA mutations"
- After your deletion: "14 users have PIK3CA mutations" (if count drops below 11, entire category is suppressed)

### 9.8 Minimum Cell Size Guarantee

We guarantee that:
- ✅ No analytics category with fewer than 11 users will be displayed or shared
- ✅ If a category drops below 11 users, it is automatically suppressed
- ✅ You cannot be identified from categories you belong to

**This protects you from statistical re-identification.**

### 9.9 Prohibited Uses

**You agree NOT to:**
- Attempt to re-identify individuals from de-identified analytics
- Reverse-engineer our de-identification methods
- Combine our analytics with external data to identify individuals
- Use analytics for discriminatory purposes
- Violate any applicable privacy or data protection laws

**Violation of these terms may result in:**
- Immediate account termination
- Legal action
- Reporting to appropriate authorities

### 9.10 No Guarantee of Inclusion

We do not guarantee that your data will be included in any specific analytics report. Due to minimum cell size requirements, your data may be excluded if:
- Your diagnosis, mutation, or treatment is too rare (<11 users)
- You belong to a demographic category with <11 users
- You opt out of analytics

### 9.11 Changes to Analytics Practices

We reserve the right to:
- Add new types of analytics (e.g., tracking treatment outcomes)
- Change aggregation methods (while maintaining HIPAA compliance)
- Expand or limit external sharing

**Notice:** We will provide 30 days advance notice of material changes via email. You may opt out or delete your account if you disagree.

### 9.12 International Users

If you are located outside the United States:
- Your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States
- De-identified analytics may be shared internationally
- We comply with applicable international privacy laws (GDPR, etc.)
- You have the rights described in our Privacy Policy

### 9.13 Research Ethics

We commit to:
- ✅ Using de-identified data ethically and responsibly
- ✅ Obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval when required
- ✅ Following research ethics guidelines
- ✅ Not using analytics to harm or discriminate against individuals
- ✅ Transparency about how analytics are used

### 9.14 Liability Limitations

**We are NOT liable for:**
- Re-identification attempts by third parties (if you use de-identified data externally)
- Inaccuracies in aggregated analytics (counts may be approximate)
- Changes to analytics categories over time
- Exclusion of your data due to minimum cell size requirements

**We ARE liable for:**
- Breaches of your personal health information (PHI)
- Violations of HIPAA or applicable privacy laws
- Negligent disclosure of identifiable data

### 9.15 Dispute Resolution

If you believe we have:
- Improperly de-identified your data
- Shared identifiable information
- Violated our analytics practices

**Contact us:**
1. Email: privacy@mytreatmentpath.com
2. Subject: "Analytics Dispute"
3. Describe the issue in detail
