## 7. De-Identified Analytics and Research

### 7.1 What We Collect

We collect **de-identified, aggregated analytics** from user data to improve our services, understand treatment patterns, and contribute to cancer research. This analytics program follows HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification standards (45 CFR §164.514(b)(2)).

### 7.2 De-Identification Process

Before any data is used for analytics, we remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers:

**Removed Identifiers:**
- Names, email addresses, phone numbers
- Geographic locations smaller than state-level (no city/ZIP codes)
- Exact dates (only year retained)
- Social Security numbers, medical record numbers, account numbers
- Device identifiers, IP addresses, biometric identifiers
- Photos, unique identifying codes
- Any other information that could identify an individual

**What Remains:**
- Aggregated counts (e.g., "15 users have bladder cancer")
- Age ranges (e.g., "56-65") - NOT exact ages
- State-level location (e.g., "Florida") - NOT city or ZIP
- Diagnosis types, mutation types, treatment types (aggregated)

### 7.3 Minimum Cell Size

To prevent re-identification through statistical inference, we enforce a **minimum cell size of 11 individuals**. Any category with fewer than 11 people is suppressed (not displayed or shared).

**Example:**
- ✅ "15 users have PIK3CA mutations" → Displayed (≥11 users)
- ❌ "3 users have rare mutation XYZ" → Suppressed (<11 users)

### 7.4 What We Track

**User Metrics:**
- Total number of registered users
- New registrations per day
- Active users (last 30 days)

**Clinical Aggregates** (minimum 11 users per category):
- Diagnosis types and cancer stages
- Genomic mutations (gene names and types)
- Treatment regimens (medications and supplements)
- Demographics (age ranges, gender, state-level location)

**We DO NOT track:**
- Individual patient outcomes linked to specific users
- Your specific treatment responses
- Any data that could identify you personally

### 7.5 How We Use Analytics

**Internal Use:**
- Improve our platform and services
- Understand common treatment patterns
- Identify areas where users need more support
- Optimize user experience based on aggregated behavior

**External Sharing:**
- Research collaborations with academic institutions
- Public health reporting (cancer registries, research organizations)
- Published research papers and studies
- Investor reports demonstrating platform impact

### 7.6 Legal Basis

Once data is de-identified using the Safe Harbor method, it is **no longer Protected Health Information (PHI)** under HIPAA. This means:

- ✅ We can share de-identified analytics externally without your additional consent
- ✅ De-identified data is not subject to HIPAA Privacy Rule restrictions
- ✅ You cannot be re-identified from aggregated analytics
- ✅ No Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) are required for external sharing

**Citation:** HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR §164.514(b)(2) - Safe Harbor De-identification

### 7.7 Your Rights

**Right to Opt-Out:**
If you do not want your data included in aggregated analytics, you may opt out by contacting us at privacy@mytreatmentpath.com. Note: Opting out does not delete your personal data; it only excludes it from future analytics aggregation.

**Right to Transparency:**
You can request information about how your data is de-identified by contacting privacy@mytreatmentpath.com.

**Right to Deletion:**
If you delete your account, your personal data is removed. De-identified analytics generated before deletion will remain in aggregate form (but cannot be linked back to you).

### 7.8 Security Safeguards

**Before De-identification:**
- Your personal health information (PHI) is encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- Access is restricted to authorized personnel only
- All access is logged and audited

**After De-identification:**
- Analytics contain no personal identifiers
- Minimum cell size prevents statistical re-identification
- Data is stored separately from personal health records
- All analytics access is logged for audit purposes

### 7.9 Audit Trail

We maintain an audit trail of all analytics access, including:
- Who accessed analytics data
- When it was accessed
- What action was performed
- IP address of the requester

This audit trail is retained indefinitely for compliance purposes.

### 7.10 Updates to This Section

If we make material changes to how we use de-identified analytics, we will:
- Update this Privacy Policy
- Notify you via email
- Provide 30 days notice before changes take effect
- Allow you to opt out if you disagree with the changes

## 8. Research and Data Sharing

### 8.1 De-Identified Research

We may use de-identified, aggregated data for research purposes, including:
- Publishing research papers on cancer treatment patterns
- Collaborating with academic institutions and research organizations
- Contributing to public health databases and cancer registries
- Developing new features based on aggregated user needs

**Your consent:** By using our services, you consent to the use of de-identified, aggregated data for these research purposes.

### 8.2 What Is NOT Shared

We will NEVER share:
- Your name, email, phone number, or other identifiable information
- Your specific medical records or treatment history
- Data from categories with fewer than 11 users
- Any information that could reasonably identify you

### 8.3 Third-Party Research Partners

If we share de-identified analytics with research partners, we require them to:
- Use data only for approved research purposes
- Not attempt to re-identify individuals
- Maintain appropriate security safeguards
- Comply with applicable research ethics and privacy laws
